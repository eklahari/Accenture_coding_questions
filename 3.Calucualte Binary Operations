"""Calculate Binary Operations
Write a function CalculateBinaryOperations(str) that accepts the string as an argument or parameter. The string should contains the binary numbers with their operators OR, AND, and XOR?
A Means the AND Operation.
B Means the OR Operation.
C Means the XOR Operation.
By scanning the given string from left to right you’ve to calculate the string and by taking one operator at a time then return the desired output.
Conditions:
The priority of the operator is not required. The length of the string is always Odd.
If the length of the string is null then return -1. Sample Test Case:
nput:
1C0C1C1A0B1
Output:
1
Explanation:
The enteredinputstringis1XOR0XOR1XOR1AND0OR1.
Now calculate the string without an operator priority and scan the string characters from left to right. Now calculate the result and return the desired output.
Note: This will convert the char into the num (char – ‘0’) in the c++ language."""

boolean_val=int(s[0])
for i in range(1,len(s)-1):

    elif(s[i]=='B'):
        boolean_val=boolean_val|int(s[i+1])
    elif(s[i]=='C'):
        boolean_val=boolean_val&int(s[i+1])
print(boolean_val)
