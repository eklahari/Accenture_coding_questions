15. MATHS IS FUN
You are required to implement the following function: int Calculate(int m, int n);
 
 
The function accepts 2 positive integers ‘m’ and ‘n’ as its arguments.
You are required to calculate the sum of numbers divisible both by 3 and 5, 
between ‘m’ and ‘n’ both inclusive and return the same.

Note
   0 < m <= n
Example :
Input:
m:12 n:50
Output
90

Explanation:
The numbers divisible by both 3 and 5, between 12 and 50 both inclusive are {15, 30, 45} and their sum is 90.
Sample Input
m:100 n:160
Sample Output
510
